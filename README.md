# Unidox
  <a href="#">Unidox</a> is a new and simple way to take notes. With a modern and out of your way interface, unidox is the best place to keep all your notes and other relevant text documents. Editing is easy on both laptops and mobile devices, making it the perfect tool for students who are always studying in new and different places. 

## Inspiration
I wanted a better place to keep my notes for school, something that was simple to use and that I could easily access on my mobile phone to study from when I didn't have my laptop on me. 

## Technology
You can find the backend code at <a href="#">unidox-api</a>. The frontend interface was built with React, utilizing
1. Functional higher order components
2. React Hooks and the Context API for state management
3. Draft.js for the text editor
4. Sass and Bulma for styling
